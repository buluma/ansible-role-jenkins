## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-jenkins/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- become: true
  gather_facts: true
  hosts: all
  name: Converge
  roles:
    - role: buluma.jenkins
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-jenkins/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- become: true
  gather_facts: false
  hosts: all
  name: Prepare
  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.epel
    - java_default_version: 11
      role: buluma.java
    - role: buluma.locale
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
```
